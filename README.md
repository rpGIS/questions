# webapp
This app provides an input form to be used from a computer-based browser. The app is split into two areas. On the left side is a leaflet map containing a draggable marker. This must be dragged from its original position to a position of your choice, at which point it will update the coordinate boxes to the right. The right side is where a question and four potential answers is enterred. The forms input will be uploaded to a database on submission.The web app can be accessed through the use of the ucesrpg folder in this repository, combined with the httpServer file in the server repository. The page also has two links at the top right, the github logo takes you to my github repository, while the help button accesses a user guide.
